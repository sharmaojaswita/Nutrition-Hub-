Nutrition Hub is a Java-based application designed to provide users with detailed nutritional information about various foods using external nutrition APIs. The application serves as a personal nutrition assistant, enabling users to search for food items and receive comprehensive data including calories, macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats), vitamins, and minerals.

Built with Java as the core programming language, Nutrition Hub integrates with a third-party Nutrition API (such as the Edamam or USDA FoodData Central API) to fetch real-time food data. Users can input food names or scan barcodes (optional feature), and the app retrieves and displays relevant nutrition facts in a user-friendly interface.

The application can be used as a standalone desktop app or integrated into broader systems like health trackers, fitness platforms, or diet planning tools. It promotes healthy eating habits by making accurate and up-to-date nutrition information accessible.
